# Mandachord  
It's Octavia's Mandachord, but it's a crappy representation of it. Essentially this is just a desktop application for people who want to make their Mandachord remixes but are away from Warframe. Could probably still get this labelled as productivity.  

## Dependencies  
SFML 2.5.0 - Visual Studio 2015 64bit  

## Build  
Clone the repo and follow the tutorial for dynamic linkage into Visual Studio on the SFML site (or static linking if you're feeling spicy).

## Installation  
If you don't want to deal with messing around in the source code and just want an app that works, there will be an entry in the Releases section soon. Patience...  

## Controls and Features  
- Spacebar: Toggles play/pause  
- Scroll wheel: Up to go left, down to go right  
- Click on things to toggle them  
- Save and load songs with ease
