# Mandachord  
It's Octavia's Mandachord, but it's a crappy representation of it. Essentially this is just a desktop application for people who want to make their Mandachord remixes but are away from Warframe. Could probably still get this labelled as productivity.  

## Installation  
There will be a releases section at some point when I'm done testing it and it is at a point at which I feel comfortable releasing it. Patience...  

## Controls  
[THIS IS WILL BE CHANGED] Arrow keys to move the screen around, click on buttons to toggle things. Easy enough.
